A Unity Project with the initial barebone structure to make a puzzle game, similar to Flow Free. Comes with a ready made puzzle system and some demos to help
any beginner or intermediate game designer or developer to get started. Scripts has a summary section and uses strong programming practices such as using 
programming patterns, OO design, and clear thought out variable and method names.
