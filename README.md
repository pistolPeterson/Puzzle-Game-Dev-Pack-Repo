# Puzzle-Game-Dev-Pack
A Unity Project with the initial barebone structure to make a puzzle game, similar to Flow Free. Comes with a ready made puzzle system and some demos to help
any beginner or intermediate game designer or developer to get started. Scripts has a summary section and uses strong programming practices such as using 
programming patterns, OO design, and clear thought out variable and method names. 

# Key Features 

![puzzle demonstration](https://github.com/pistolPeterson/Puzzle-Game-Dev-Pack-Repo/blob/main/MD%20Resources/puzzle%20system%20demo%20for%20git%202.gif)


- A fully made node connection based puzzle system using grid based connections to drive and validate connections. 
Uses Unity Events as well as a psuedo linked list approach to check if a connection is valid.
- Combo system that keeps track of the latest connection you made. Uses the Queue Data structure. 
- Demo scenes
	- Demo A: A "debugging mode" that exposes some variables that you can manipulate. 
	- Demo B: A fun little musical example, in which you increase the intensity of the music as you make more connections.



# How to Install 

**Coming Soon**: WebGL Build to play the demo scenes online! 

**Current Unity Version** is **2020.3.32f1**  
This will most likely be updated every month to the lastest Unity LTS version.
